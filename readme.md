# Project

## Description
In this project, I used the [shibe.online](shibe.online) API to get JSON objects that contain multiple links to images of cats, dogs, and birds. 
Then, I created a webpage that used http-style server commands to allow the user to select which types of images they'd want to display, and then loop through the entire object to display each linked image.

## How to run
In your desired local directory, run ```git clone https://github.com/macynarang/webdevproject```.
Once you have the code locally, run ```npm install ``` within the directory to re-download the packages.
Use the command  ```nodemon index.js``` to run the server. Visit the webpage at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in your web browser.
